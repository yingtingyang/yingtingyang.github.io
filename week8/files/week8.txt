Topic:  Make an improvement on a word cloud. Let a user input text onto the page, and then use the page to visualize the body of text that was entered.

How could you make a visual representation of word counts that conveys information more effectively, insightfully, or interestingly than a word cloud?
To do this you would take your javascript object with all the word counts, loop through it, and create graphics using them as data.
You could create a bar chart (boring but ok), or bubbles, or any other visual form you feel like. You could say textSize(concordance[word[i]]) to directly impact the size of text based on the word count for example.
This is primarily an information design experiment to get you experimenting with the concordance.
The example will get you started with the concordance itself. Its up to you to use the canvas (via p5.js for example) or other means to visualize it.

use TF-IDF or Bayesian statistical analysis. Check out Dan Shiffman's implementation of TF-IDF, a lot of whose work informed this class topic:
